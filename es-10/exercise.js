//double equal operators trys to convert to the number the given data types and after that they compare them, if their numbers are equal to each other then it returns to true or if not they return to false 

yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted
//the triple equal operators don't convert the datas to the numbers. They just compare them as they are, so if one side is boolean true and second side is 1 they aren't same with each other becuase boolean isn't a number and number isn't a boolean so this is the main difference between they.
yearsCompleted === firstYearCompleted
